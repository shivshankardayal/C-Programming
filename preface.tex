\chapter{Preface}
I welcome you to this pdf version of 
\url{http://libreprogramming.org/books/c/} which is a complete rewrite. That 
was my first attempt to write at such a large scale and therefore there were 
many deficiencies in that version which I hope have been countered and
corrected in this version. In the HTML version I had put a lot of emphasis on 
specification. However, the feedback which I got from some of my readers is 
that it has become complicated and is not suitable for beginners. After 
thinking over it I found that it is the order of chpaters which needs to be 
corrected and a lot more examples and exercises need to be there.

In this rewrite I will arrange the chapters in a different way. The empahsis on 
specification will be treated in the last part of book. Also, it will contain 
links to youtube videos which I have created for C programming and if you want

\section{What this book contains?}
This book contains explanation of C99 specification and syntax of C programming
language for beginners. Examples and exercises have been provided to help the
reader become better at programming. Ideally, this book should be used with a
high school or university course for a semester course on C but I have made
every attempt to keep it suitable for self-study. I have created youtube videos
for further help. One can also communicate with me directly over me by email to
report errors in the book or for help.

\section{Who should read this book?}
People interested in learning C should read this. Anybody can read this book
who has little background on Mathematics. I would say high school education is
sufficient for reading it. It can also be used a reference document for C99
specification because I will be convering almost entire document at the end of
book. Also, note that even though C11 is out \texttt{gcc,} which has been used
as the compiler throughout the book has not got complete support for C11
yet. As soon as compiler will support it fully I will start work on C11
version.

\section{How to read this book?}
Well, learning programming is like learning a new language and then solving
problems is like Mathematics. So the latter is more important as unless you can
solve the problem on pen and paper, you cannot solve the problems using
C. However, teh focus of this book is to explain the features and syntax of C
programming language not on how to solve the problem. For this latter part you
should consult a book on data structures and algorithms.

For syntax highlighting I have used \texttt{minted} \LaTeX{} package which uses
\texttt{pygments} as its backend. You can modify it and make it look different
both at \LaTeX{} and \texttt{pygments} level.

\section{Acknowledgements}
I am in great debt of my family and free software community because both of
these groups have been integral part of my life. Family has prvided direct
support while free software community has provided the freedom and freed me
from the slavery which comes as a package with commercial software. I am
especially grateful to my wife, son and parents because it is their time which
I have borrowed to put in the book. To pay my thanks from free software
community  I will take one name and that is Richard Stallman who started all
this  and is still fighting this never-ending war. When I was doing the Algebra
book then I realized how difficult it is to put Math on web in HTML format and
why Donald Knuth wrote \TeX{}. Also, \TeX{} was one of the first softwares to
be released as a free software. HTML has not yet matured to represent
mathematical content. MathML is supported by Mozilla. Webskit browsers started
supporting 
then dropped and I would refrain to comment on commercial browser's support
which do not even comply to starndard because they think they are the standards
tehmselves and others will bend to their will.

Now as this book is being written using \LaTeX{}~ so obviously Leslie Lamport
and all the people involved with it have my thanks along with Donald Knuth. I
use Emacs with Auctex and hope that someday I will use it in a much more
productive way someday.

I have used PSTricks as a tool for drawing all the diagrams. Therefore I am
grateful to its original creator Timoth Can Zandt and current maintainers Denis
Girou, Sebastian Rahtz and Herbert Voss.
